              <h4>history</h4>
              <p>
                During the classical period, several Eurasian kingdoms conquered
                what is known today as Georgia. The Colchis and Iberia Kingdoms
                inhabited the region in the 4th century and introduced
                Christianity that is still prevalent in Georgia to this day.
                After the introduction of religion, the Georgia unity kingdom
                dominated the political and economic structures of the 12th and
                13th centuries during the reigns of King David IV and Queen
                Tamar. Eventually, Georgia was conquered by several kingdoms
                including the Mongols, Ottoman Empire, and several Iranian
                rulers. The Eastern Georgian Kingdom forged an alliance with the
                Russian Empire in the 18th century who eventually annexed and
                conquered both Eastern and Western Georgia. In 1917 following a
                revolution, Georgia established the first republic in the world
                governed by the social democratic ideology. This independence
                was brief as Russia invaded and absorbed Georgia into the Soviet
                Union in 1921, imposing socialist ideologies. Georgia regained
                its independence in 1991 with the fall of the former USSR.
                Although it has struggled with civil wars and Russian
                occupation, it has made significant gains in strengthening
                institutions.

              <h4>Location</h4>
              <p>
                The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersections of
                Western Asia and Eastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the
                west, Russia to the north and Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to
                the south. Georgia follows pro-western democracy and is a member
                of the UN, WTO, Council of Europe, European Bank for
                Reconstruction and Development, and the GAUM Organization for
                Democracy and Economic Development among others. On the Asian
                side, Georgia is a member of the Asian Development Bank but
                maintains close military ties with predominantly European
                States. Currently, Georgia is seeking to join NATO and the EU
                through radical democratic and institutional reforms. However,
                Georgia houses two “independent countries” that are Asian
                leaning and are recognized by Russia and some Asian countries.
                The country is led by an executive president as the head of
                state, and a prime minister as the head of government. The
                country has a unicameral parliamentary system.

              <h4>Identity</h4>
              <p>
                Clinging to both European modernity and the Asian culture,
                Georgians, just like many in the Caucasus region, have
                historical backgrounds in Eurasia. Despite the topographical
                definition of Georgia, few Georgians identify themselves with
                Asia. Determining whether or not Georgia is a part of Europe or
                Asia is more difficult than it may seem. As the Caucasus
                Mountains are sometimes considered to be the easternmost border
                of Europe, the country of Georgia is technically located in
                Asia. However, culturally, many people in Georgia consider
                themselves part of Europe. The truth is that this Eurasian
                country could fit into either Europe or Asia, depending on which
                definition you use.
